This is a project created during Devsuperior's "Intensiv√£o Java Spring" course.
I'm incredibly grateful to Devsuperior for offering this amazing free course with such valuable content.
Every topic covered in the course was thoroughly explained. One thing that I particularly appreciate is the teacher's enthusiasm in teaching all aspects of Spring Boot. With over twenty years of experience as a developer, he deeply appreciates the convenience that Spring Boot provides. This enthusiasm and friendliness make it almost effortless to comprehend complex concepts.
